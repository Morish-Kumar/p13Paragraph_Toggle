how does react works - we use react to build user interfaces using the components 


reatc dom - interface to the web
react basically take care of the changes that occured in the components and send those changes to the DOM which then take care about rendering the changes 

NOTE: whenever state, props or a context of a component changes that component is re-executed and that component is re-evaluated by react

Vritual DOM Digging - findin out the difference between two snapshot


if a component is re-executed then all its child component will be re-executed and re-evaluated

How can we prevent un-neccassary re-evaluation?
we have have use React.memo(component_name) for whichever app we want to  prevent the un-neccassary re-execution and re-evaluation


useCallBack hook - hooks that allow us to store a function across component execution and function stored should not be recreated with every execution
